TODO
- color entire live piece during collision
    - Need to separate color from game board state
    - Hard to remove a live piece, non-collision
- enum for game state?
- animate cleared pieces green for a few frames.  Maybe flash alternating colors???
- use max XY piece dimensions and topl/botr key in add/remove functions
- remove repeated shapes and apply random rotation??
- 3 live pieces
  - cycle with L/R
  - Show preview of queue on right side
- Scoring system
- Optimize copy_piece_to_board_state() and remove_piece_from_board_state() to not check full grid
